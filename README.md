# GNU/Linux Luma

## 🚀 Linux Luma
Linux Luma is a Debian-based distribution meticulously engineered to transform low-end hardware into powerful workstations for software development.

The goal is simple: provide the stability of Debian with a stripped-down, high-performance environment that stays out of your way and lets you code.

## 🎯 Why Linux Luma?
Modern operating systems often waste precious CPU cycles and RAM on visual effects and background telemetry. Linux Luma reclaims those resources for your compilers, IDEs, and Docker containers.
